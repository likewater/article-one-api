# Article One
## An application to locate and communicate with congressional representatives.

## To Run:
* Install Android Studio
* Clone this repository from [Git Hub](https://github.com/likewater/article-one.git)
* Open Android Studio and choose to open an existing project.

## This project uses the [ProPublica Congress API](https://www.propublica.org/datastore/api/propublica-congress-api).

# Synopsis

As of June 19, 2017 the application is in an acceptable state for presentation as an MVP.

Things that need to be addressed and polished are below:

* Tighter styling.
* Experiment with a different font-family and color palette.
* Experiment with different layouts.
* Basic user testing.
* How to make a second API call in conjunction with the first.
* To make the second call refactoring into one class model needs to occur.
* The app needs to be a communication bridge that can link users with reps - social media via implicit intents would be part od phase two and dependent on that second api call.
